# NYC Realtime Traffic Analysis

*Note: This application builds on top of the sample application provided by TomTom API. You can find the original tutorial here: [TomTom Traffic Tutorial](https://developer.tomtom.com/maps-sdk-web-js-v5/tutorials-use-cases/traffic-tutorial).*

This repository offers a detailed analysis of real-time traffic data in New York City, combining both **traffic flow** and **incident** data to deliver actionable insights. The project is designed to provide users with comprehensive visualizations of current traffic conditions, helping optimize travel routes and identify congestion points.

### Key Features
- **Real-time data extraction**: Leverages the TomTom API to fetch both live **traffic flow** and **incidents** data for NYC.
- **Interactive visualizations**: Clear and dynamic visualizations of traffic patterns across NYC, enabling better decision-making for commuters and analysts.

### Enhancements from the Sample Application
- The traffic flow style has been customized to use `absolute` speed values (in km/h) instead of the default `relative` flow style.
